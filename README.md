## üß≠ Overview

In this project, I implement automated functional end-to-end (E2E) tests using Codeceptjs with JavaScript, following BDD practices with the Gherkin language using Cucumber tool, and applying the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern. The goal is to ensure the quality and reliability of the Farfetch Application.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Structure of the Project

This project was designed with a focus on **scalability** and **ease of maintenance** for both existing and future test scenarios.

The tests are written in **Gherkin language** using the **Cucumber** tool, which enables the creation of test scenarios following the **BDD (Behavior Driven Development)** approach. These files can be found in the `features` folder.

<img width="1339" height="573" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dafe548f-4780-4fd7-8405-816e6247b933" />
&nbsp;

The step definitions are written in JavaScript with CodeceptJS, a powerful end-to-end testing framework that simplifies writing tests using a high-level, readable syntax, and are responsible for executing the steps described in each test scenario defined in the `features` folder. All step definition files are organized in the `step_definitions` folder.

&nbsp;

This project follows the **Page Object Model (POM)** pattern, a best practice that improves code organization and maintainability. Inside the `views` folder, you will find variables that containing selectors to identify HTML elements, and functions implemented in **Codeceptjs + JavaScript** to perform the actions needed for the functional tests.

## üß™ Automated Test Scenarios in this project

In this project, I have automated three test scenarios taken from the list above:

- ### **1. Change to an available language**  
  Tests changing to an available language such as "Spanish", "Russian", "Chinese", among others, verifying that the application changed to the correct language.

  &nbsp;

- ### **2. Change to an available region**  
  Tests change to an available region, such as "Brazil", "Canada", "Japan", among others, verifying that the application changed to the correct region.

  &nbsp;

- ### **3. Search product by brand name**  
  Tests searching by various brands, including "Gucci" and "Nike", validating the correct display of products from those brands.
